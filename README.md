Website backbone is based off of an implementation of Svelte 3.5, Storybook 7 and TailwindCSS 3. You can find the *original* source code for the template here: [Svelte + Storybook + TailwindCSS Template](https://github.com/jerriclynsjohn/svelte-storybook-tailwind)

I'd recommend trying the base template before wrestling with my repo. [jerriclynsjohn](https://github.com/jerriclynsjohn) did a great job!

When the website is further along in development, it will likely have TailwindCSS removed and replaced with more custom CSS. SASS is still available early-on though, since I have never been able to get enough of it!

## Usage

This website is intended to serve as an online presence for an indie game development startup. It has several pages of interest, all in an attempt to cover all the basic needs of a game development company's website.
It will have a structure similar to this:

- Landing Page (Hero page)
- Home (Social media feed, news and announcements)
- Games (Completed projects, webGL games, and links for where to find them)
- Our Projects (Active and upcoming)
- Media (Gallery, clips, screenshots)
- Assets (Freebies, asset store links, templates)
- Contact Us (Contact form, customer support, marketing and commission information)

You can find more information about what has and hasn't been implemented yet using the [Kanbn Extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samgiz.vscode-kanbn-boards). Note that this is a fork of the original extension, with some updates.

## Frameworks

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is a component framework that allows you to write highly-efficient, imperative code, that surgically updates the DOM to maintain performance.

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

## Tools

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is an open source tool for developing JavaScript UI components in isolation.

[SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) is a stylesheet language thatâ€™s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax.
